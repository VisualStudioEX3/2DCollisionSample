This project is a little sample of how to implement a simple 2D collision system and their implementation in C# with XNA, also compatbile with MonoGame.

The sample shows how to detect collisions between different bodies, implement the response to the collision, how to trace rays for calculate trayectories in the scene, and how to implement trigger areas (for raise events).

The code is programmed in a way to be less dependent from the XNA/Monogame framework, to be easy to port to other languages and frameworks.
